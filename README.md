# Inconsistent Units in CSS calc() Leading to Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS: inconsistent units leading to unexpected results.

## Problem

The `calc()` function in CSS allows for dynamic calculations of lengths. However, if the units used in the calculation are inconsistent (e.g., mixing percentages and pixels), the result may not be as expected. This can lead to unexpected layout or spacing issues.

## Solution

To avoid this problem, ensure that you use consistent units within the `calc()` function.  If you need to combine different units, consider using intermediate variables or pre-calculating values to ensure accurate results.
