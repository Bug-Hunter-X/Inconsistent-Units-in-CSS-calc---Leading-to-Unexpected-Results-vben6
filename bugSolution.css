To solve this, ensure consistent units are used within the `calc()` function.  One approach is to convert all units to a common unit (e.g., pixels) before performing the calculation:

```css
:root {
  --container-width: 500px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(var(--container-width) * 0.5 + 20px);
}
```

This ensures that the calculation is performed using pixels only, resulting in a predictable outcome.  Alternatively, you could use variables to help manage the units and improve readability:

```css
:root {
  --width-percentage: 50%;
  --width-pixels: 20px;
}

.element {
  width: calc(var(--width-percentage) + var(--width-pixels));
}
```

Remember, the best approach depends on the context and your specific layout needs.
